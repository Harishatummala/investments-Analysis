Investments Analysis

I have successfully completed all seven tasks of the Power BI Project on Investments for Cognifyz Technologies.This project delves into various trends in investment choices by analyzing a sample of peopleâ€™s preferences and trends, with a particular focus on gender-based differences.

Task 1: Data Exploration and Summary: In the initial phase, I delved into the dataset to understand and summarize key statistics.

Task 2: Gender-based Analysis: I created compelling visualizations comparing investment choices (equity, mutual funds, government bonds) based on gender. The insights derived from these visualizations highlighted significant gender-based trends, providing valuable information for strategic decision-making.

Task 3: Objective Analysis: Analyzing the correlation between savings objectives (e.g., Capital Appreciation) and investment avenues (e.g., Equity), I generated insightful charts showcasing preferred investment choices for each savings objective.

Task 4: Investment Duration and Frequency: Visualizing the distribution of investment durations and conducting frequency analysis on investment monitoring frequencies, I gained a deeper understanding of the temporal aspects of investment. This analysis shed light on how the duration of investments and monitoring frequencies impact preferences.

Task 5: Reasons for Investment: Identifying common trends in reasons for investment, such as Better Returns or Tax Benefits, I created visualizations showcasing the most frequently cited reasons for investing.

Task 6: Source Analysis: Visualizing where individuals get their investment information (e.g., Newspapers, Internet), I conducted an insightful analysis to determine the most commonly relied-upon sources by investors.

 The insights gained from gender-based trends, objective analysis, and source evaluations contribute to a comprehensive understanding of investment behavior.
